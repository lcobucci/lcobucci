# Why do I do Open Source Software?

I use my open source projects as a way to express my ever-changing ideas about
software design, learn new concepts, circulate thoughts, and get feedback.

Some projects were created because I simply didn't like the design of other
implementations available at the time, had energy to propose something else, and
decided to allow others to try my solution.

Don't get me wrong, I do get extra motivated when my projects are used out in
the wild. However, ⭐ stars and 📦 downloads aren't the things that make me stay awake
coding new stuff after having already gone through my paid daytime-job.

## If not ⭐ stars and 📦 downloads, what do you expect to get out from OSS?

I'm just looking for having an impact on making our convoluted industry simpler
and helping people (directly or indirectly) to become better software engineers.
It's not something measurable, I know, and that's okay 😁

I do get financial support via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lcobucci),
which I'm very grateful for and helps me on prioritising OSS work whenever I can.
