### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For many years I've been contributing to the PHP ecosystem by creating and supporting libraries that make our lives easier.

I've collected a good set of production-grade libraries and experiments, which you may use and contribute to!

#### Some info about my work

To clarify my PoV on it, I wrote these pieces:

* [Why do I do Open Source Software?](why-do-I-do-oss.md)
* [What's my policy on version support?](version-support.md)
